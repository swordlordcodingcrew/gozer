Gozer is not Zuul. Cayenne and Wicket based web UI framework.

# status
This is a very early dev version. We currently migrate sources from a project to a standalone lib. While things once were production ready, we first need to upgrade to new middleware for a release.

# dev
To make dev ready, run these:

tools/apache-ant-1.10.1/bin/ant resolve -> installs required libs to /lib/jar/

Use /.idea files when using IntelliJ IDEA.
